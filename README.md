# Preface

The project uses `PyQT5` development technology and relies on the `Python` language. This software's code style is not recommended for learning purposes, as it's my first time writing desktop software in `Python`. For those accustomed to using `WPF`'s `Xaml` programming, `PyQT5` is quick to get started with but still a nightmare to write, at least for this attempt. The software does not use any architecture, making maintenance a challenging task ü§Æ. I will try my best to ensure it is free of any severe bugs.

For me, the experience of completing this `PyQT5` project is unforgettable. Although I love programming, it's the first time a software project has made coding feel irksome. Perhaps it's due to my unfamiliarity with the `PyQT5` library or my over-reliance on the convenient tools provided by Microsoft ü§î.

# GeoTectAI_CNN Overview

This project uses `PyQT5` as mentioned earlier. Writing desktop software with `Python 3.10.14` has felt catastrophic, especially during packaging. The project's goal is to use **basalt**'s more **dimensional** **geochemical data** to differentiate tectonic environment categories by training a convolutional neural network with 42 feature elements.

Thanks to the libraries and their developers, this project primarily relies on the following libraries (in addition to the Python standard library):

* QFluentWidgets
* Matplotlib
* PyQt5
* numpy
* PyTorch

If you want to compile this project further, please install the libraries mentioned above first. The software will only be packaged for Windows, and it might be a bit large. I am not very skilled at packaging Python projects.

If you encounter any problems during use, feel free to leave a comment under the project's **Issues**.

# Dataset

Data is sourced from the large geochemical database [GEOROC](http://georoc.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de/georoc/) (üåπ**Thanks to the database and numerous researchers for providing data support**üåπ). The project's training dataset will be stored in the project's `DataSet` folder. I will later publish and explain the specific data and preprocessing procedures.

# Convolutional Neural Network Model

The model structure will be announced in due course. The code for training, testing, and interpreting the convolutional neural network model will be stored in the `ML_Code` folder.

Please note: when calling the related code, make sure you have installed the necessary packages.

# Software Workflow

The software is divided into: **Home, Prediction Module, Settings Module**.

* The home screen displays relevant instructions.
* The prediction module consists of three processes:
  1. **Import Data**, where you can perform initial settings like setting the title row and auto-match mode.
  2. **Validate and Match Data**, inspecting and matching the imported data to establish mapping for the next prediction step.
  3. **Model Prediction**, where I've implemented multi-threading. However, I suggest avoiding any illegal operations during prediction. After prediction, results will be displayed on related cards. You can click on an item to view its specific prediction probability. We will add the prediction result to the last column of the data and name the last column `predict_res`. You can view the predictions by exporting the results.
* In the settings, you can switch themes, styles, languages, and other options.

Since this software is entirely developed in `Python`, I don't need to call deep learning code via third parties, making the project code relatively straightforward.
